# ðŸŽ¯ Chessboard Analysis using AI & Computer Vision

This project solves the challenge of detecting and analyzing a **chessboard image (partial or full)** using AI and computer vision techniques. It counts the number of black and white squares, even with **rotations**, **slants**, or **lighting distortions**.

---

## ðŸ§  Objective

To demonstrate problem-solving and AI skills by building a robust chessboard analysis solution that works in real-world conditions using OpenCV in Google Colab.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Key Features

- Detects both **partial** and **full** chessboards.
- Handles **slanted/angled images** and lighting variations.
- Counts the number of **black** and **white** squares.
- Annotates detected squares and displays results.
- Designed for **non-technical reviewers** through clear visualization and simple explanation.
